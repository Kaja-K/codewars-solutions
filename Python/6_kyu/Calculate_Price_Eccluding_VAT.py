'''Write a function that calculates the original product price, without VAT.

If a product price is 200.00 and VAT is 15%, then the final product price 
(with VAT) is: 200.00 + 15% = 230.00 Thus, if your function receives 
230.00 as input, it should return 200.00

Notes:
    VAT is always 15% for the purposes of this Kata.
    Round the result to 2 decimal places.
    If null value given then return -1'''

def excluding_vat_price(price):
    return round(price / 1.15, 2) if price is not None else -1
